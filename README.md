My JavaScript (with TypeScript) solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

Based off [LBognanni's Advent of code Typescript Starter](https://github.com/LBognanni/adventofcode-typescript-starter)

## How to use

For each day, where `x` is the day number (1-25):

- ▶ run `npm run setup x` from your terminal
- 🌐 Visit <https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/x/input> and copy the contents in your `inputs/dayx/input.txt` file
- 🔴 Update the example input and result in the test case in your `.spec.ts` file
- 🟢 Implement the necessary logic in `solveForPart1`
- 💪 TDD all the things!
- 🔁 Do the same for part 2
- ⌨ `npm test` to run your tests
- ⭐ `npm run start x` to run the day's test
- 🎉 Profit!
